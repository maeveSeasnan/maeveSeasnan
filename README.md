# About Me

My name is Maeve, and I'm an entry-level professional in software development with a growing interest in psychology and social work.

- 🔭 I’ve recently completed my Associate of Applied Science in Software Development.
- 🌱 I’m working toward my Bachelor of Arts in Psychology.
- 💬 Ask me about Falcor, my axolotl, my goal to live off-grid, or my journey balancing school and life as a software development student!
- 📫 How to reach me: https://www.linkedin.com/in/maeve-seasnan/
- 😄 Pronouns: they/them (but I’m totally cool with casual references like “girl,” “dude,” or “bro”!)
- ⚡ Fun fact: Axolotls can regenerate their limbs, which is basically their way of saying, "No problem, I got this!"—kind of like how I tackle challenges in life.
