# About Me

My name is Maeve and I'm a software development student with a growing interest in UX/UI design, leadership, and marketing!

- 🔭 I’m currently working toward an Associate of Applied Science in Software Development, along with certificates in Marketing Specialist and Leadership.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++ programming, GitHub, microeconomics, and strategies for leading social change.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on beginner-friendly projects that help me grow as a developer.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with landing an entry-level software development job where I can apply my skills and continue to learn.
- 💬 Ask me about Falcor, my axolotl, my goal to live off-grid, or my journey balancing school and life as a software development student. I’m always happy to share!
- 📫 How to reach me: https://www.linkedin.com/in/maeve-seasnan/
- 😄 Pronouns: they/them (but I’m totally cool with casual references like “girl,” “dude,” or “bro”!)
- ⚡ Fun fact: Axolotls can regenerate their limbs, which is basically their way of saying, "No problem, I got this!"—kind of like how I tackle challenges in life.
